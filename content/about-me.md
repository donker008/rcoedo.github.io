I'm *Roman*. I come from *A Guarda*, a little fishing village in the southern *Galicia*, *Spain*.

I have a strong *Java* and *Spring* background
and good experience building backend and frontend stuff with *Node*, *JavaScript*, *React*, *Webpack* and friends. 
I'm currently getting myself into *Golang*, *Ruby* and *Elixir*.

I've been deeply interested in computing since I was a kid. When I was on highschool I used to build small portals in *php*. I became more and more interested in web development,
for this reason I moved to *A Coruña* to get a degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.udc.es/" target="_blank">Universidade da Coruña</a>.

In <a href="https://jclouds.apache.org/blog/2014/09/23/google-summer-of-code-2014-results/" target="_blank">2014</a> and

I attended the Google Summer of Code program and colaborated with the <a href="https://jclouds.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache jclouds project</a>.

I currently work at a nice consultancy agency called Trabe in *A Coruña* building all kinds of cool things.
